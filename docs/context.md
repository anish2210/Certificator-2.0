# Certificate Generator SPA - Detailed App Flow & Features

## Overview
This SPA (Single Page Application) enables users to generate personalized certificates from a Google Sheet containing participant details. Users can upload a certificate template, map fields from the sheet onto the template, and bulk-generate certificates, which are then downloadable as a ZIP file.

## Features

### 1. **Google Sheet Integration**
- User inputs a Google Sheet link
- Fetch and display sheet data preview
- Allow users to select specific columns for mapping

### 2. **Certificate Template Upload & Configuration**
- Upload a certificate template (PNG, JPG, or PDF format)
- Interactive drag-and-drop interface to map Google Sheet fields onto the template
- Adjustable font styles, sizes, and colors

### 3. **Bulk Certificate Generation**
- Iterate through Google Sheet rows and populate mapped fields
- Generate individual certificates as high-resolution images (PNG/PDF)
- Allow preview of a few sample certificates before full generation

### 4. **Download Certificates**
- Create a ZIP file containing all generated certificates
- Enable individual certificate downloads if needed

## App Flow

### Step 1: User Inputs Google Sheet Link
- User pastes the link to the Google Sheet.
- The app fetches and displays the sheet content.
- User selects the relevant sheet if multiple sheets exist.

### Step 2: User Uploads Certificate Template
- User uploads a certificate template (image or PDF).
- The template is displayed in an interactive UI.

### Step 3: Field Mapping
- The app extracts column headers from the Google Sheet.
- User drags and drops text placeholders onto the certificate.
- Each placeholder is mapped to a sheet column.
- User customizes font, size, color, and positioning.

### Step 4: Generate Certificates
- The app loops through each row of the sheet and replaces placeholders with corresponding data.
- Certificates are generated dynamically and previewed.

### Step 5: Download Generated Certificates
- A ZIP file is created containing all certificates.
- User downloads the ZIP or individual files as needed.

## Tech Stack

## API & Libraries
- Google Sheets API for data extraction
- Fabric.js for interactive field placement
- PDF-lib for PDF modification

- Ensure proper CORS handling for API requests

## Conclusion
This SPA provides an intuitive and scalable solution for bulk certificate generation. With Google Sheets integration, a dynamic template editor, and automated bulk processing, it simplifies the certificate creation process significantly.
